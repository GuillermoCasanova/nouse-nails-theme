      <h1>The Cybersecurity Marketing Society Independent Marketing Operator Membership</h1>

      <p class="lead">Historically, the Cybersecurity Marketing Society membership has been limited to in-house, full-time marketers at cybersecurity products and services companies.</p>
      <p>In 2026, we are launching a <strong>limited-access (100 only), one-year beta test</strong> of the Cybersecurity Marketing Society Independent Marketing Operator Membership.</p>
      <p>The Cybersecurity Marketing Society Independent Marketing Operator Membership is a paid membership for independent cybersecurity marketing professionals who operate as freelancers, consultants, or fractional leaders (such as fractional CMO or fractional PMM).</p>
      <p>Independent Marketing Operator Members gain access to the Members-only Society Slack community, internal Members-only calls, and receive a complimentary replay pass of the most recent CyberMarketingCon.</p>

      <h2>Expectations of Independent Marketing Operator Members</h2>
      <p>The goal of the Cybersecurity Marketing Society is to foster an environment where authentic, non-transactional connections and networking occur. Marketers power the cybersecurity industry, and the Cybersecurity Marketing Society is a sales-free zone where freelancer members follow a dedicated set of community rules designed to prevent spam and sales-driven behavior. The Society actively moderates the community to enforce these standards.</p>

      <h2>Society Independent Marketing Operator Membership Code of Conduct</h2>

      <h3>Freelancer Participation Rules</h3>
      <p>The Society is not a place to build or promote your services. As we welcome cyber-focused freelancers and fractional marketers, protecting the Society as a sales-free, trust-based community is non-negotiable.</p>

      <h3>Cybersecurity Focus Required</h3>
      <p>Independent Marketing Operator members must have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Proven, repeated cybersecurity marketing experience, or</li>
        <li>Multiple active cybersecurity product or services clients</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Society is not intended for learning cybersecurity in order to sell into the community.</p>

      <h3>Member Recommendation Required</h3>
      <p>Freelancer applicants must name at least one existing Society member in good standing who can vouch for their participation and community fit.</p>

      <h3>No Selling. Period.</h3>
      <p>The Society is not a lead source, CRM, or prospecting channel. Freelancers may not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Promote services, availability, or rates</li>
        <li>Position themselves as the solution to a member's problem</li>
        <li>Offer audits, "quick calls," or help that leads to a pitch</li>
        <li>Share service packages, client outcomes, or case studies</li>
        <li>Use soft CTAs like "happy to help" or "reach out if you want to go deeper"</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Subtle selling is still selling.</em></p>

      <h3>No Using Society Info to Sell Elsewhere</h3>
      <p>What you learn in the Society stays in the Society. You may not use community conversations to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prospect via LinkedIn, email, or other channels</li>
        <li>Reference Slack discussions in outreach</li>
        <li>Target members based on shared challenges, tools, or budgets</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Not selling inside the Society but selling because of the Society is still a violation.</em></p>

      <h3>Required Freelancer Identification</h3>
      <p>All freelancers must display the designated IMO emoji at the start of their Slack display name at all times. The emoji is issued by the Society. It must remain visible while you are a freelancer member. Removing or altering it is a rules violation. If your employment status changes, notify the Society so your designation can be updated.</p>

      <h3>Recommendation-Only Visibility</h3>
      <p>Freelancers may only be surfaced if another member independently recommends them based on real experience. If recommended, freelancers may briefly acknowledge the recommendation and move to DMs only if the requester initiates or agrees. Freelancers may not respond to "looking for a freelancer" posts on their own behalf or signal interest or availability.</p>

      <h3>Keep Help Public</h3>
      <p>If help can't be shared openly in Slack and without expectation of follow-up, it likely doesn't belong here.</p>

      <h3>DMs Are Not a Loophole</h3>
      <p>Sales-related DMs require explicit opt-in. Prior conversation or friendliness does not equal consent.</p>

      <h3>Profiles Are Not Ads</h3>
      <p>Slack profiles, bios, and status messages may not function as marketing. You're here as a peer, not a vendor.</p>

      <h3>We Look at Patterns</h3>
      <p>Moderation considers patterns of behavior, not just single messages. Repeated steering toward your services or private follow-ups will be treated as selling.</p>

      <h3>Same Rules for Everyone</h3>
      <p>Tenure or role doesn't change expectations. These rules apply equally to full-time employees, those between roles, fractional marketers, freelancers, and consultants.</p>

      <h3>Enforcement</h3>
      <p>Violations may result in immediate removal without warning. Removal does not include a refund of membership fees. Protecting the community experience outweighs individual membership.</p>

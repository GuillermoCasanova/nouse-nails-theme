Press it down from cuticle to tip, using the wooden stick provided to roll out any air bubbles for a smooth, sealed finish. Cure under the LED lamp for 60 seconds, then clip and gently file or buff off the excess for a perfect shape."

Avoid baths, oils, or lotions 1-2 hours after application so the gel can fully set.\n3. Use the wooden stick provided to roll out any air bubbles and seal the strip before curing.\n4. Align each strip only on the nail bed. Avoid overlapping onto the cuticle to prevent lifting."

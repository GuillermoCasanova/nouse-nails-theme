Choose a strip that fits slightly inside your nail line and leave a small gap at the cuticle. Never overlap onto the skin or cuticle—adhesive only sticks properly to the nail bed, and overlap can cause early lifting.</p>"

            "question": "If a strip is slightly small, how do I make it fit?",

Note: this only works for slightly smaller strips; overstretching can tear the film or distort the artwork.</p>"

With good prep, your Nous nails can handle gym sessions, dish-washing, typing, and all-day life—minus the click-clack.</p>"

Use the wooden stick to gently lift the edges, adding more remover as needed until the strip slides off completely. Once removed, you’ll notice your nails feel healthier—no harsh drilling, no salon damage, just clean removal and care.</p>"

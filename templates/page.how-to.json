Choose a strip that fits slightly inside your nail line and leave a small gap at the cuticle. Never overlap onto the skin or cuticle—adhesive only sticks properly to the nail bed, and overlap can cause early lifting.</p>"

Once softened, apply and gently stretch to fit. <em>Note:</em> this only works for slightly smaller strips; overstretching can tear the film or distort the artwork.</p>"
